# Energy-data-analysis-Project 1
Energy data analysis projects using Python and pandas

This repository contains energy data analysis projects using Python
and pandas, focusing on cost and performance comparison of renewable
energy sources.

Objective:  To analyze and compare the cost per MWh of Wind, Solar, and Biogas energy.

Tools & Skills used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Data cleaning
- Cost per MWh calculation
- Data visualization (Matplotlib)

Key Insight:
Wind energy shows the lowest cost per MWh, while biogas provides a
reliable backup energy source due to its dispatchability despite
higher costs.

This project is part of my learning journey toward becoming an
energy analyst, with a focus on energy systems.
